  This is actually my second attempt at taking this photo. The first time it was so windy that I had to hold my tripod down even with my bag already weighing it down because it would have been blown over otherwise. In that other photo there's no reflection on the water cuz there's a bunch of big waves instead. But here, you can see the lights (over this 10 second exposure) clearly reflected on the water. There's also a bit of Jersey City on the left, and the Empire State building (behind the Brooklyn Bridge) on the right.</h3>

  Personally it kind of bothers me because this image isn't super sharp, and I think it's actually a limitation of my lens, but ultimately it still looks pretty cool and that's what matters!</h3>
