  Boston Library</h2>
<h3 class="description">
  It's like a nicer version of New York's public library.</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  The interesting thing about libraries in cities (e.g. this library, the one in Bryant Park in NYC, etc.) is that if you go during normal hours there's probably about as many tourists as there are people actually studying or looking for books.</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  I guess if I had to find a place to study, and just happened to be in Boston, near the library, this would be a good place to go. Also to be fair, it is very pretty. Actually there were some people taking wedding photos there, although that's kind of weird but maybe they're nerds.</h3>
