  Yeah I tried pretty hard on that transition.</h3>

  So unfortunately I was a little more to the left and a bit lower this time and that's why the two photos don't line up perfectly. Also this is a really disappointing photo for me, I feel like you need to have a zoomed in picture of the sunset, honestly this just looks like shit and there's a bunch of kayakers in the way too.</h3>

  Aside from that I guess it was really cool to watch in person - much better than this shitty photo conveys. It's also funny because there's a shitload of people around taking pictures of it. You can see a small portion of them on the left here, but there were so many people crowded up behind me that I couldn't even move... Good thing I got there about an hour early.</h3>
