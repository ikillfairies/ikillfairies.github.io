  Montreal counts as northeast, right?</h3>

  Yeah so I know it's Canada but this bar was pretty cool. The street it's on is mad shady but once you go inside and out the back door, there's this really cool patio thing that's got a bunch of leaves growing up the walls. It was really nice and cool there too (was hot as balls outside).</h3>

  Montreal's a pretty cool place I guess, which is why I went for my birthday! The food's pretty good (poutine and shit), but anyway the problem is everyone speaks French. Like they mostly all speak English but they just speak French anyway because it's the cool thing to do and they wanna be Le French people I guess.</h3>
