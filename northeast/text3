  Literally a random shack in a ghetto parking lot.</h3>

  One of the few cool things about working for Epic was going on go-lives. Of course, the shitty part is that you're basically just creating extra work for yourself by going on them, but aside from that it's a nice free trip out to some place. Needless to say, I took the opportunity as often as possible and that's how I ended up here. </h3>

  Actually this was a go-live for Lahey, which is the not Partners owned hospital group in MA. They have this one random hospital up in Gloucester (which btw is pronounced Gloss-ter) and I was there for two days or so. One of the days I went out here to a place called Causeway Restaurant which has decent seafood and massive portions. There was a random shack in the back so I took a picture cuz it looked cool. Yep, lame story I know.</h3>
