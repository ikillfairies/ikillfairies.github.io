  Lobster Roll</h2>
<h3 class="description">
  Yeah so McDonalds in MA sells lobster rolls...</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  To be honest though, it's really nothing special, and it's kind of expensive (relative to McDonalds prices I guess). Well it's not bad either I guess. Just tastes like lobster on a bun with mayo. Wait that's what a lobster roll is right? Meh.</h3>

  One other mildly interesting thing is that this McDonalds, which is near Boston Commons (it's a park in Boston) is run by almost all Cantonese people, it's really weird cuz when's the last time you saw a McDonalds in America run by all Asians?</h3>
