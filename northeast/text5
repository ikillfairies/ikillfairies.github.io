  I'd been meaning to stop by here (Gantry State Park) for a while after seeing a cool photo at the Short Hills Mall in some douchey looking upscale store that sold photos printed on acrylic for thousands of dollars. Anyway yeah turns out it was Manhattanhenge that day (Memorial Day weekend) and there was a small photographer army assembled there waiting...</h3>

  By the way, you see that tiny bridge in the middle of the picture? Apparently people wait on it (in Tudor City) for 8 hours for the Manhattanhenge shot. That must suck cuz they got nothing this day... But at least I got a cool photo of the lights turning on at night I guess?</h3>
