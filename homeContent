  <center>Hi, I'm Jeff, and this is my website.</center>
  <br>
  I currently live in New York, NY, and work for Flatiron Health, but I'm originally from Livingston, NJ and studied at Carnegie Mellon University where I graduated in 2014 with a B.S. in Chemistry and minor in Business Administration. Last year I lived in <strike>the midwestern wastelands</strike> Madison, WI where I worked for Epic Systems and ate alot of cheese curds. In my free time, I take pictures, bike, eat, snowboard, make things, and play video games... So if you happen to have any fun hobbies or ideas on things to do, please contact me &#9786;
