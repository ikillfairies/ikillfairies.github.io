  Incase you're wondering, this was taken when I got out of my car in the middle of a county highway in northern Illinois. And yes, those are cornfields on both sides.</h3>

  Also on an unrelated tangent, I got a ticket here and there's always cops right about where I took this photo because this road (which is like 6 miles of straight road) has a 55 mph speed limit. I kind of assume this is how Ottowa county in Illinois makes most of it's money because seriously why is the speed limit not at least 65? Anyway, they dismissed the ticket so that's cool but seriously wtf.</h3>
