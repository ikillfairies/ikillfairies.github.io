  Get the jalapeno cheese bread.</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  This market is open on Saturdays from summer to fall with stands set up all around the capitol square in the middle of the isthmus. If you happen to go there, just ignore the overpriced organic crap and go straight for the jalapeno cheese bread. Seriously it's really good, and probably the only thing there that's worth it (although they run out after a few hours).</h3>

  Overall it's fairly nice if you're bored on Saturday morning in the summers. The lake is right there so there's a good breeze with some nice scenery, and also I would suggest going before lunch if possible to get that bread fresh. On a more related note, apparently Wisconsin honey (pictured) is a thing.</h3>
