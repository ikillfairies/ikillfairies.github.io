  The old courthouse at St. Louis has a ton of flags hung all over. It's also where you go to buy tickets for the Arch. Speaking of the Arch, I guess it's kind of worth it once, but I would definitely never go up that thing again. The little lift car that you take up is super janky and incredibly tiny and I kept hitting my head on the curved ceiling. Also, you can see some tiny windows at the top of the Arch if you look at it from the ground. The thing is, they're actually that small. Plus it smells weird.</h3>

  By the way, did you notice the homeless man bathing in the fountain? Look again - bottom left.</h3>
