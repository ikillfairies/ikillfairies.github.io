  So I think this is supposed to symbolize how St. Louis was the gateway for westward expansion of the U.S., which makes sense. Didn't Oregon Trail start here? You can see the river and the other side of St. Louis if you turn around and look out the other side of the Arch too. Anyway the view is nice, there was a baseball game going on that day (you can see all the red in the stadium), and overall St. Louis is pretty nice as far as Midwestern cities go.</h3>

  Oh, you can see that fountain where I took the previous picture just above the courthouse here.</h3>
