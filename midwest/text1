  State Capitol</h2>

  Apparently I have alot of pictures of this building.</h3>

  Did you like that image fade/transition between the capitol buildings? I didn't even line it up on purpose. Anyway, this is where Governor (and failed presidential candidate) Scott Walker works. His office wasn't all that impressive (from the outside at least), though the inside of the building is pretty nice. By the way, you can go on the (sort of) roof of the rotunda, and since for some reason no buildings are taller than the state capitol, it has a great view!</h3>

  Oh. Also... You see that building on the left? The one to the left of the Wilson St. sign? For some reason there's a lot of homeless people always gathered outside that building and I still have no idea why.</h3>
