  <h3 class="description">Lake Monona is on the south-eastern side of the Madison isthmus and is overall a pretty nice place once you get over the insects (in the summer). The lake also freezes in the winter which is pretty neat if you don't mind the cold and wind. You'll usually know when it's safe to go out for a walk on the frozen lake because there'll already be a ton of people out there ice fishing.</h3>
