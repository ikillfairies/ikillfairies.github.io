  Monona Terrace</h2>

  Okay, last picture of this lake (and Wisconsin).</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  Actually I really only wanted to include this one to just show the frozen lake. This is a photo of Monona Terrace with the capitol peeking over the top from a few hundred feet out on the lake in winter. You can even see a little ice fishing tent set up on the left there. We kinda screwed up the silhouette thing because it was too cold and I sucked at holding my phone's flashlight. But incase you're wondering how it's supposed to be done, you do a long exposure, shine a light on yourself for a few seconds, turn the light off, and then run out of the photo.</h3>

  I actually happened to fall through thin ice near the shore, so both of my feet/legs got wet up past the ankles. That made for a fairly unpleasant photo taking experience, but overall this is definitely a very cool thing to try in the winter time. The vast majority of the lake was frozen with at least 4-6 inches of ice, so it was pretty solid and safe. I think last year it got to 16 inches or something.</h3>
