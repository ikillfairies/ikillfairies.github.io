  The Bean</h2>

  Actually I think it's called Cloud Gate.</h3>

  But everyone calls it The Bean anyway. It makes sense though if there's some clouds (which in this picture there aren't, oops), because you can see them moving very quickly accross the surface (because of the rounded shape). Still looks like a bean though. As you can tell, there's always a ton of tourists here, but if you go in the winter time when it's really cold, you can get a clear photo with no one in the way. Only, then it'll also be really cold.</h3>

  Millenium Park has other cool stuff nearby like the Navy Pier, Buckingham fountain, Shedd Aquarium, some nice gardens in the summer, and a figure 8 shaped outdoor ice skating rink in the winter. By the way Shedd costs 30 some bucks, it's kind of a ripoff.</h3>
