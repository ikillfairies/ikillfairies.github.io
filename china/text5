  Hey, I work(ed) there!</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  I think there's alot of beautiful photos of Epic in the summer floating around the internet, so I decided to upload one from the wintertime when it's freezing cold and most of the campus is yellow and dead. This is the main cafeteria, which usually has a nice waterfall (frozen on the right in this photo), and a cool pond (bottom the photo, also frozen).</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  The building on the left is a huge and super nice training building, where customers/Epic staff take classes and marvel at the wealth of the healthcare industry. Actually almost all of the buildings are pretty fantastic, which is good because the campus itself is literally in the middle of nowhere. Seriously, Verona has a population of just over 10,000... and Epic has 10,000 employees.</h3>
