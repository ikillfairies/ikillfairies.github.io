  Actually this is kind of making my mouth water I'm not gonna lie. I'm writing these with the picture open on the left, and a text editor open on the right and it's making me drool a bit.</h3>

  This is what taco al pastor looks like before it becomes a taco. I live in NYC now and I see some food trucks with really disgusting crappy versions of this. It kinda looks like a piece of skinny brown spam on a stick. That's bullshit taco al pastor.</h3>

  This is real taco al pastor. The different places sometimes cook it a bit differently, but mostly you'll see it in a big cone shape with a fire behind it, and they spin it on a stick above some onions with a pineapple on top.</h3>
