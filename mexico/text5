  Taco Al Pastor I</h2>

  No bugs in these, but they were pretty damn salty.</h3>

  Actually taco al pastor in Mexico City is really damn good. It's typically street food (you'll see in the next picture) and it's really delicious especially with salsa verde, but I do think it's a little too salty.</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  That actually leads me to another point, you know how everyone says don't drink the water in Mexico City? I think no one actually drinks the tap water there because they sell water in absolutely gigantic jugs (probably 10+ gallons?) at the supermarkets.</h3>

  Ok back to talking about how delicious these tacos were, holy shit they're so good. I'm actually really hungry writing this so I'm going to stop.</h3>
