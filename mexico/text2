  I'm totally kidding, this looked just as disgusting in real life as it did in this photo. I actually didn't try it because we had fried worms the previous night and they were just about as bad as you might imagine. So, yeah grasshopper tacos didn't sound too appetizing to me.</h3>

  By the way it really actually is just fried grasshoppers with guac on a tortilla. Yep. Mexican delicacy. Also I'm 70% sure I got food poisoning from this place, but that's totally another story.</h3>
