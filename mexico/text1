  Basically shitty old Mexican pyramids and tourists.</h3>

  I think most people go to and think of Chichen Itza when they think of Mexican pyramids. Although, that might just be a 'lets do something slightly cultural while on spring break' thing. Anyway yeah so Teotihuacan is home to the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, both of which are legit just piles of rocks cemented together.</ih3>

  I guess I might be giving it a bit too much shit but seriously it's just like you get on a bus in Mexico City and ride out to some middle of nowhere tourist destination. All in all it's not too bad but it's just... Not that great either.</h3>
