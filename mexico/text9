  Vasconcelos Library</h2>
<h3 class="description">
  Coolest library ever (in Mexico).</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  So this library has a bunch of 'floating' floors and shelves, it actually looks super cool and the colors are really fantastic too. I would highly recommend checking it out and just walking around for fun. The one drawback is that you have to sign a special waiver and get a weird touristy necklace badge thing if you have a real camera. Only if you have a real camera. Like, if you take pictures with your phone that's totally fine, but if they see you with a DSLR, you'll get this weird person telling you off until you sign a waiver saying you promise you won't sell your photos or some bullshit. Yeah, super weird, I know.</h3>

  Okay so that aside, another weird thing about this library is that it's really empty. I don't mean empty like no people, I mean there's really not that many books in it. I mean sure maybe Mexicans might not read that many books but the entire 3rd floor is basically empty, whats up with that? If I had a really pretty library that was basically a tourist attraction (aka, this one), I'd probably buy shitty encyclopedia books that no one would ever read just to fill it up and make it look nice. Anyway if you Google pictures of it, you probably won't see any of the top floor... Cuz there's nothing there.</h3>
