  These are called 'cinturon de seguridad por sus ni√±os'.</h3>

  I didn't really see it too much elsewhere but it's really a common thing in the park. I guess if you're afraid of your kids running off, it makes sense, but I'm pretty sure that girl on the left is around 10 years old...</h3>

  The park itself is alright, we didn't get a chance to see the zoo but the castle on top is pretty cool. There's a panoramic view of the city up there and you can tell that the Spanish took some prime real estate when they built. Also the grass is very nice.</h3>
