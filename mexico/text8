  Hey get a picture with the asian people!!</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  Asian people must be rare in Mexico (kind of true, I guess Asians don't want to go to Mexico City), and maybe because of that, we got 4-5 people who asked to take pictures with us. This is Peter being interviewed by some students or something (mostly because he's Asian). Another woman actually took a picture of us with her kid which was pretty hilarious.</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  Oh, the cathedral itself is pretty nice too, very European like the rest of the buildings in the area.</h3>
