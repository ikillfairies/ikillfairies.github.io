<h1>TRAVEL</h1>
<h4>
  Have you ever wanted to see the world through someone else's photoshopped pictures? If so, look no further! Each of the links below will take you to a page where you can explore amateur photographs (and read my boring descriptions) about places I've been in the last year and a half. If you notice any bugs, it's probably because the code for the animations sucks and you should never put animations in your site.
