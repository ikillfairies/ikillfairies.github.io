<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
<h4>I'm assuming that when I finish this site, I'll put up some pictures and maybe guides (if I'm bored enough), on random projects I've done, or other cool things like building a bamboo bike or paper crossbow.<br><br>By the way, incase you're wondering why the background images on this page load alot slower, it's because I haven't bothered to photoshop them and make them smaller since I'm not going to use them on the finished site.</h4>
