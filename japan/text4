  Lake Mendota</h2>

  It's like Lake Monona, but bigger, and called Lake Mendota.</h3>

  On the northern side of the isthmus is Lake Mendota, which is slightly bigger. There's some cool stuff around it, and you can take a walk to a place called Picnic Point (pictured) to get a great view of the lake. There's some campfire sites set up along the trail where you can have BBQ's (or picnics in this case I suppose).</h3>
<h3 class="description">
  Would also be cool if you have a boat (which I don't).</h3>
